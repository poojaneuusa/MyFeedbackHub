## About the project
MyFeedbackHub - Full-Stack Web Application
Implemented User Authentication & Security: Integrated NextAuth.js for secure user authentication, using credential-based login and JWT tokens to manage user sessions, with bcryptjs for password hashing and Zod schema validation for input validation.

Anonymous Feedback System with GPT-3: Developed an anonymous feedback platform using OpenAI GPT-3 for dynamic and engaging question generation, allowing users to send and receive feedback while maintaining privacy.

Full-Stack Development & Real-Time Interaction: Built a responsive front-end using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with back-end API routes for user management, feedback submission, and email verification, leveraging MongoDB for data storage.

Deployment & Error Handling: Deployed the application on Vercel, ensuring seamless performance and high availability, with robust error handling to manage authentication and feedback processes securely.
